## Sample 1

Scales NGINX workload based on Azure Queue.  NGINX doesn't process messages from the queue. This is just a demo to explain Keda.
Use python program to add messages to queue. This needs two environment variables - refer python program to set them easily (change command as apporpriate - such as namespace, etc)

## Sample 2

Scales K8S workload based on another K8S workload 

## Sample 5

Shows how to use pod identity to authenticate. This is also the same sample code shown in this blog.
